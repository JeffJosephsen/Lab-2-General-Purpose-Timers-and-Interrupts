# TIVA-ARM-General-Purpose-Timers-and-Interrupts
Abstract:  In this lab the student gained familiarity with general purpose timers and software interrupts.  Timers and interrupts were used to light LEDs and signal to systems when a button had been pressed.  Appropriate registers were initialized and updated by way of pointers.  A vector table, named cstartup_M.c, was used to declare, define, and place  interrupts in the correct bit location of the interrupt register.  Interrupt Service Routines, or ISRs, were written and named Timer_Handler or GPIO_PORT_X_Handler.  These ISR Handlers would then interrupt regular processes flow (like my children often do) to require the system to complete a divergent set of code.  In the last part of the Lab it was found that the timer handler needed to be disabled and enabled via the timer clock enable bit for completion of other appropriate processes.
